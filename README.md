# Dark Pastel Atom Theme

Atom theme based on the [base16 tomorrow dark](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) colors - in this version, the colors are a little less jarring to the eyes, and the backgrounds are themed to fit very smoothly with the [spacegray theme](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray).

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_Syntax Themes_ drop-down menu.
